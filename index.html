                    <p>
                        Welcome to the homepage of the Coq algebraic geometry project. Small algebraic geometric developments have been 
                        done in Coq many times, but as far as we know there has been no bottom-up development of modern (Grothendieck-style)
                        algebraic geometry in Coq. This project is intended to fill this gap, and also to demonstrate that Coq and SSReflect/MathComp 
                        is capable of handling high-level, abstract mathematics, in addition to low-level, concrete mathematics which it is well-known
                        to be able to handle well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project is in many ways inspired by the <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/">Stacks Project</a>, in that we
                        also start with few preliminaries and build up the tools necessary to develop algebraic geometry step-by-step; it is 
                        also motivated in part by Lean's <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">Mathlib</a>. We take as 
                        granted Coq's expressive Gallina specification language, the SSReflect proof language and the Coq <a href="https://math-comp.github.io/">
                        Mathematical Components</a> library, and formalize the required stepping stones towards algebraic geometry. We do not 
                        necessarily follow the Stacks Project in our formalization, but like the Stacks Project, we aim to build a coherent library of 
                        related mathematics along our way. Eventually, however, this project would not necessarily be limited to algebraic geometry:
                        we are also interested in expanding in other related directions, such as homological algebra and topos theory.

                        Currently, our main goal is to define the notion of an affine scheme, i.e. a locally ringed space 
                        isomorphic to the spectrum of a commutative ring with unit. This requires a bit of category theory and commutative algebra, as well 
                        as some sheaf theory.

                    <p>
                        We intend to do a formalization of "textbook" algebraic geometry, which relies heavily on non-constructive reasoning principles 
                        (especially the Axiom of Choice). Therefore, we always assume functional and proof extensionality, decidable equality 
                        for every type, and the type-theoretic Axiom of Choice in our development.

                    We would love to have some collaborators, especially those who are experienced in using SSReflect/MathComp to formalize 
                    mathematics, and those who have some expertise in algebraic geometry.
